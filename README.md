## The Haskell CI Group

This group meets monthly to discuss the effective use of CI (broadly
understood) with Haskell. It is a forum to share experiences, ask questions,
discover new resources together, and coordinate our work. Anyone who operates
in the intersection of Haskell and CI is welcome to attend meetings and join the
discussion.

Over time, this repository will accumulate knowledge and information about CI
and Haskell, and we'll be actively looking for opportunities to share that
knowledge with the community.

## Joining the Group

Contact bryan@haskell.foundation for an invite! The next meeting is on December
14, 2023, at 6:00 and 12:00 UTC (subject to change as needed).

Want to help develop the group itself? PRs to this repo are also welcome!
